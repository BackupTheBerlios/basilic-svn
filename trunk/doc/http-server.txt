Server runs on :

http://hostname:port/

hostname is computed by the server. Default port is 6666

To test the operation of the server with default configuration file, use your internet browser with url :

http://localhost:6666/test

You should see a welcome message. If not, check the configuration, the read FAQ, then ask in mailing-list.

Recommended installation tip
----------------------------
One should install basilic behind an apache proxy, preferably SSL, so that url becomes :

https://basilic.mydomain.com/ or http://basilic.mydomain.com/ 

This virtualhost is a stupid rewrite rule to :

http://localhost:6666/

TODO: Add an apache example file here.
