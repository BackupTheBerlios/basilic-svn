Installation Scenarios
----------------------
----------------------

Engine Install
--------------

Engine needs to be installed first.
Say the we want to install basilic to 
PREFIX=/usr/local/

Installation directory is basilic-%(version)s. So, by default, basilic 1.0 will want to install at :

/usr/local/basilic-1.0/

This directory is stored into ENGINE_DIR variable

An installation is the following steps :
0/ make i18n
1/ Recurse Copy skel/engine to ENGINE_DIR
2/ Copy src/*.py to engine/lib/
3/ Recurse Copy src/locales to engine/locales
4/ Recurse Copy doc to engine/doc
5/ Compile engine/lib/*.py
6/ Recurse Copy skel/instance to ENGINE_DIR/instance-skel
7/ Copy utils/mkinstance.py to ENGINE_DIR/bin

Instance Making
----------------
An instance is created from the ENGINE_DIR. It's now current dir.

To make a new instance, run bin/mkinstance.py

0/ collect INSTANCE_DIR
1/ mkdir INSTANCE_DIR
2/ recurse copy instance-skel to INSTANCE_DIR
3/ apply INSTANCE_DIR/start.sh.in into INSTANCE_DIR/start.sh
4/ run INSTANCE_DIR/start.sh --make-defaults, this will write INSTANCE_DIR/etc files
