API
===

General syntax is :

/[operation]/[parameters]

- operation is the main verb of the syntax. Default (if none is provided) is "request". 
 
- parameters syntax depends on operation.

List of possible operations is :

- request (default)
- test
- debug

-> What about a "set" operation in order to use bookmarklets

API for "test" operation
------------------------
/test : returns "OK" string, a newline, and the full copyright ; if configuration is good and server running. Never returns anything is server doesn't run.

API for "debug" operation
------------------------
/debug : If server in debug mode (debug=1 in config file), this will return a debug page.

API for "request" operation
---------------------------
/request/[userlogin]/[userbase]/["tags"/[tag1[+tag2[+tag3]]...]]/[format]

All items are optional, but have to be furnished in this order.

[item] means item is optional 
"item" means item is the expected string (a marker)

Result is always a string in given format. Default format is XML. 
Encoding is set in the HTTP header. Default is utf-8.

- userlogin : specifies that the request is only for given user
- userbase : specifies that the request is restricted the userbase(s) named "userbase"
- tags : if this marker is present, then next parameter has to be a tag or a set of tags
- tag1 : if marker "tags" is set before, this is the tag used to constraint the request.
- tag1+tag2+... : multiple tags have to be separated with an operator (like "+", which is interpreted as "AND" operator).
